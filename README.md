# My first Repo

I am a student on MSc Data Science for Cultural Heritage at UCL, London.

I am starting a project for Historic Royal Palaces on the conservation of the Abraham Tapestry hanging in the Great Hall at Hampton Court. My project will strive to employ imaging and machine learning solutions to improve the understanding of the current state of this magnificent artwork from Tudor times, as well as its behaviour to predict changes and tackle damage.

In the near future, I would like to undertake a research focussed on the preservation of XXI century's musical archives from private collections.
